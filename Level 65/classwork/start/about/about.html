        <h1>WELCOME, MY FRIENDS!</h1>
        <pre>
        My name is Kristina Carrillo-Bucaram, and many know me 
        as "FullyRaw Kristina."

        I'm a writer, speaker and raw vegan activist who educates
        and guides people who are sick and tired of feeling "sick 
        and tired" and are ready to take more control over their
        health and experience the compassionate lifestyle one can 
        achieve by living FullyRaw.
        
        FullyRaw is not just a diet. Its a lifestyle. I like to think of 
        this way of eating as an awakening and way of 
        rediscovering connection with ourselves, with others, and 
        with our earth. I really believe it begins with food, and then 
        it becomes a mind, body, and spirit transformation. It's a 
        way for you to build the foundation that will lead you to a
        healthier, happier, and more abundant life. I'm here to help 
        guide you through the journey of returning to yourself. As
        you dive into these programs, the recipes, the videos, the 
        workshops and more, you're going to discover just how 
        powerful fruits and vegetables really are for our bodies. I 
        truly believe that food is medicine because I have seen its 
        substantial transformational abilities myself. It's a mind, 
        body, spirit journey.</pre>

        <pre>
        At the age of 16, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, more specifically, 
        hyperglycemia. It was devastating to think this would be something I would 
        suffer from for the rest of my life. That wasn't good enough for me. I was 
        determined to find a way to take control of how I was feeling and live a fuller 
        life where I wasn't bogged down with the symptoms of hyperglycemia.</pre>
